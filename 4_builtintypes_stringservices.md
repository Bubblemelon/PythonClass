[Python Standard Library Chapter 7 - String Services](https://docs.python.org/2/library/strings.html)

1. Built-in types - [Python Standard Library Chapter 5 - Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html)    
  a. What is a type? A container for information in Python. Lets avoid a more strict definition [because the topic is very detailed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system).    
  b. Principal builtin types are numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes, instances and exceptions.    
  c. We often think of data types when we consider types. [Python Standard Lirary 8.15 - Data Types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datatypes.html)    
  d. However, functions, iterators, sequences, file objects, modules, and pretty much everything else is a type. I don't really know where this definition ends. I know some builtin functions are in C and keywords probably aren't types.     
  e.     


2. Lets dig into some practical types - Numeric, Mapping, Iterator, Sequence, Set, File Objects
  a. Numeric - int, float, long, complex.    
  b. Also check out [Python Standard Library Chapter 9](https://docs.python.org/2/library/numeric.html)    
  c. Mapping - Only built-in mapping is the dictionary.
