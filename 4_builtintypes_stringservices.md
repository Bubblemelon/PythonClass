1. Built-in types - [Python Standard Library Chapter 5 - Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html)
  a. What is a type? A container for information in Python. Lets avoid a more strict definition [because the topic is very detailed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system).
  b. Principal builtin types are numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes, instances and exceptions.
  c. We often think of data types when we consider types. [Python Standard Lirary 8.15 - Data Types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datatypes.html)
  d. However, functions, iterators, sequences, file objects, and pretty much everything else is a type.
