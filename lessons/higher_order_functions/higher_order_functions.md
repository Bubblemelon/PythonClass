### Higher Order Functions

Exploring dynamic argument and keyword quantities, nested functions, higher order functions, closures, and decorators.

If you get behind in this lesson, just keep typing/copying/running code. The topic is hard at first, so if it feels hard, things are going as planned.

1. Nesting Functions



2. Using `(*args, **kwargs)`:



3. How to get a nested function to close. Also known as a closure.    
    i. A what? A [closure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) - Simple definition: A function that binds a set of 'private' variables.    
    ii. How could this help write useful code? Control flow. Private functions for specific environments. Passing variables to a function based on the context of the function. 
    iii. Why not just put the environment in the global scope? You could. Security, compartmentalization, memory efficiency, code reusability.  Closures are a sophisticated, optional tool.





Preparing for this lesson:

1. Read [Python Scopes and Namespaces](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces)
2. Optional: [Pep 227 - Statically Nested Scopes](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0227/)
