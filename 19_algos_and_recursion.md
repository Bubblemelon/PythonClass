####Recursion and Classic Sorting Algos


#####Goals:    
-disambiguate and apply proper terms    
-iterate on a few select classic problems    
-provide additional tools and foundation for future complexities    

1. World of Data Structures and Algos: justification of lesson (30 min)    
    a. already using them all the time: implemented by language designers        
    b. common / Uncommon use cases    
    c. CS education / how to best learn this stuff [great official resource](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html)    
    d. interview questions: how to prep on both sides, terminology, etc.    
    e. sum of all preceding numbers problem    
    f. understand with print statements and time module               

3. Recursion: three rules (30 min)    
    a. must establish a base case    
    b. must change state, moving towards the base case        
    c. must call itself recursively    
    d. implementing cleanest solution    
    e. [fibonacci problem](http://www.math.fau.edu/MathCircle_at_FAU/MC130713Problems.pdf)       
    

4. Binary search, Algo speak, and Timeit (30 min)    
    a. algorithm: a set of instructions used to produce a definitive result     or    
        A step-by-step problem-solving procedure, especially an established, recursive computational procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.    
    b. data structure: a container for data with explicit restrictions    
    c. [big-O complexity chart](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)(scroll to just above comment section)    
    d. [from book](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/AlgorithmAnalysis/BigONotation.html)    
5. Merge Sort (20 min)    
    a. understand with print statements
