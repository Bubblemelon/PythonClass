####Recursion and Classic Sorting Algos

-present the case of fibonacci
-pose question of merge sort
-go into what data structures and algos are
-solve for merge sort
-disambiguate terms and O notation

1. World of Data Structures and Algos: justification of lesson (20 min)    
    a. Already using them all the time: implemented by language designers        
    b. Common / Uncommon use cases    
    c. CS education / how to best learn this stuff [great official resource](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html)    
    d. Interview questions: how to prep on both sides, terminology, etc.     

2. Recursion: three rules    
    a. must establish a base case    
    b. must change state, moving towards the base case    
    c. must call itself recursively
