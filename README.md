### PSAs and Events

**PSA 1-26-15:** As of February 1st, attend PyClass on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Thursday in the Church Classroom will replace the Wednesday in Church Classroom session.

**PSA 10-1-14:** PyClass starts at 7:00 PM, try to come a few minutes earlier. We want to finish up by nine so people can hack or catch their preferred train home.  You can come at any time, but YMMV (your mileage may vary).

**PSA 8-19-14:** The [noisebridge wiki](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) and [github readme](https://github.com/PyClass/PyClass-lesson-plans) files have the same information and updates.

**PSA 8-16-14:** The new curriculum for the Noisebridge PyClass is a crash course in the Python standard library, also touching on modules that are popular but not quite part of the standard modules. Scroll down to see the course list.

### Scheduled Weekly Meeting Times

We set up the space at 6:45 PM - try to arrive early to help if you are able to.

* Tuesday 7:00 - 9:00 PM PST - 'Turing' Classroom
* Wednesday 7:00 - 9:00 PM PST - 'Church' Classroom

### Class Description, Goals, and Ideal Student

The pace of the courses will be fast, and the materials will be available online 24/7. We plan to frequently repeat modules with new twists as we iterate over course materials.

A major PyClass goal is to break down the courses into independent units. In other words, you won't fall behind if you miss a week. Sounds good, right?

#####The 'ideal student' for this course can grasp the following code (feel free to use web resources to look up anything you don't understand):

```python
letter_frequency_dict = {}
word = "noisebridge"
 
for letter in word:
    times = letter_frequency_dict.get(letter, 0)
    times += 1
    letter_frequency_dict[letter] = times
```


##### We use the [Socratic Method](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/socratic-teaching/606):
###### A Socratic questioner should: 
1. keep the discussion focused
2. keep the discussion fact based\*
3. stimulate the discussion with probing questions
4. periodically summarize what has and what has not been dealt with and/or resolved
5. draw as many students as possible into the discussion.

\* [intellectually responsible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_responsibility) can be effectively replaced with 'fact based' for our needs.

To best experience the course, spend a short time reviewing the course materials before you come in. If you wish to know this week's courses, please join the mailing list and send an email out to PyClass@googlegroups.com

For the sake of our sanity we use Python 2 for this course.

**We accept refugees using all operating systems. You will be politely prodded in the direction of solutions that are closer to posix standards: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#Mostly_POSIX-compliant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#Mostly_POSIX-compliant)**


Some routes:    
1. Install a linux virtual machine on another computer using virtualbox.    
2. Use the command line in your apple machine.    
3. Explore POSIX for windows: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX_for_Windows    
    

Another critical tool is git:    
*Windows: http://git-scm.com/download/win    
*Mac: http://git-scm.com/download/mac    
*Linux: (use your package manager)
