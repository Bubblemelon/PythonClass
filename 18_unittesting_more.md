####Meaningful Unittesting and TDD

1. Why Even Write Tests (My code works fine)    

2. Review of how to use assert and unittest framework    
    a. example (polygons, angles, words)   
    b. checking in on terminology: test fixture, test case, test runner, test suite    
    c. special methods that we get 'for free'    -from nose.tools import assert_equals
    d. should we test individual classes and methods?             

3. Writing Meaningful Tests    
    a. edge cases    
    b. what a unit test really means    
    c. bit of philosophy / story of objects    

4. TDD: getting started with tdd using unittest    
    - what can we write?     

5. why would one make setUp and tearDowns    
   -temp file    
   -temp directory    
   -database connection    
   -db transaction    
   -open socket connection    
   -a signal generator putting out a test signal    

6. other frameworks for TiP
    a. what is nose and how to use    
        -Noseâ€™s tagline is "nose extends unittest to make testing easier"
        -what is the nose api?
    b. py.test

-package level fixtures
-module level fixtures
-class level fixtures
-class method level fixtures
-function level fixtures: 'oddball of the bunch' in nose done with the @with_setup decorator, which is included from nose.tools

@with_setup(setup_function,teardown_function)
def test_a():
    pass
