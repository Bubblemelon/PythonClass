### Munge and Analyze


#### Materials:
- Python 2.7
- A copy of the ngsl.pickle file in this repository (see the lesson folder)
- These types: list, dict, int, string
- The python pickle library (included in every version of Python)
- 

#### Goals:
- Import our pickled ngsl word list back into a Python instance
- Clean the list items to include only acceptable characters (a-z)
- Come up with fine-grained goals for how we will analyze words and letters.
